Yeah, listen, I want to help my favorites
To find that spark again
Somewhere deep in their hearts again
Man, chasin' them is how I made it
I felt this for a while, but couldn't frame it
In the proper rhythms, it seems like they stopped just like givin' a fuck and I fuckin' hate it
'Cause where you supposed to look on days when you feel unmotivated?
When all your heroes either disappeared or sound so deflated
The younger generation hellify, no, I won't debatе it
But they want what I got right now and one day they gon' obtain it
Still I find it hard to rеplicate what I'm longin' lately
That childish admiration like back when I had posters hangin'
I do my best with this first, but shit, maybe there's no explainin'
Just ventin', it's no complainin', but listen to me
For years, I felt like an only child with no one to play with
The older kids I watched run up the slides the wrong way or hang upside down from monkey bars
While I was lookin' from afar, just hopin' for that future day
When I'd be able to do the same shit, but now that day's hit
Momma done let me come outside, but now them slides are vacant
The big boys done skated
They pockets got too grown, for some it seems that love is gone
And now they pass the time with expensive glasses of wine at locations with the finest accommodations
And I ain't hatin', just more so thinkin' about complacence and the realization that one day that's what my fate is
Their greatest hits fill up my playlist, not so much their latest, and I fuckin' hate it
For selfish reasons I think I could help them reignite the flame and fall in love with this again
If they could trust in young Jermaine, we'd do our drills, we'd shake the rust
We'd blow the dust off of the pain and go shake up the game
And maybe then I'd have someone I want to be again
But even as I write that thought, I don't believe it, dang
'Cause maybe it wasn't even them, it's really me that changed
Maybe it wasn't even them, it's really me that changed
Hmm, shit

I never understood the phrase "It's lonely at the top"
Until I scaled that mountain all the way up 'til it stopped
And if you're ever blessed enough to make it to this spot
You'll see the ones you looked up to, unfortunately, had to drop
